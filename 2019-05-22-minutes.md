# Minutes for 2019-05-22 meeting


## Agenda

* Piloting 'donate' button on R Ecology lesson (what it could look like:  https://lessons.carpentries.org/dc/ecology-r/index.html)
* A 'lessons.carpentries.org' URL
* CI spellchecking PR https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example/pull/264
* Lesson infrastructure mailing list?
* FYI: 'Container Camp' Docker lessons from CyVerse https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/container_camp_workshop_2019/en/latest/index.html

## Attendees

- Maxim Belkin
- Sarah Brown
- Rémi Emonet
- Cam Macdonell
- François Michonneau

## Notes


### Donate button

* Color of donate button: red is standing out too much for the donate button: use the same color as the theme? use a "nice light green"?  red could signal error

### lessons.carpentries.org

* François is working on a s3 bucket to mapping to make that work, because the
  separate .github.io domains confuse some people

* some technical issues related to reliance on github defaults throughout (for links):

    - relies on jekyll extension github metadata
    - uses the branch information, especially some R that use master as default
      but host via gh-pages (used for the "improve this page" button)
    - confusion is around carpentries relationship to github because of
      subdomain (ie people think we're related to github somehow)
    - could do like datacarpentry (datacarpentry.org/lessonname)
    - change would be primarily to url confirguration and redirects, but could
      be a change to hosting as well
    - change would ony be to hosting built sites not to reposity hosting
    - using s3 provides a solution to also having all lessons and possibly also
      standardizing the naming of the lessons:
      *  using full name in the URLs:
         https://lessons.carpentries.org/datacarpentry/ecology-r or
         https://carpentries.org/lessons/datacarpentry/ecology-r
      * using acronym good for programming but can be confusing for people not
        familiar with the organization
        [Maxim]: https://carpentries.org/data-carpentry/lesson-name, https://carpentries.org/library-carpentry/another-lesson 
        
    - would redirect work for old links to <>.github.io/lesson links if moved to
      s3?
      - would work for datacarpentry
      - would be more work for library and swc
      - Creating a single page that lists all the lessons

### CI spell checking


Shouldn't make build fail, but possible warning
Cannot merge if it's an error
Need to reduce false positives 
Travis cannot produce warning not error?
There is separate github checking (https://developer.github.com/actions/)
also needs to move to styles from lesson-example

Possibly could check only the part that was added (@maxim is this what you said?)

Currently reports some false positives due to acronyms in code output cells

BA suggest to change to by or be  maintainers would have to maintain individual false positive word lists

Could something like David's language translation to share info across repos (discussed here: https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-infrastructure/blob/master/2018-10-24-minutes.md)
