  members of infrastructure committee, and then contact maintainers to let them
  know it exists, and ask for feedback.

  workshops and click on the exercises/solutions they want to send to the
  Etherpad.

## Transition to using bundler

* Bundler provides more solutions than problems. Should try to support older
  operating systems if possible
* Need to look into documentation for installation especially for Windows
* Look into the "vendor" directory
