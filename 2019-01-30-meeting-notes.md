## Agenda

### Lesson Releases

- repo with scripts: https://github.com/swcarpentry/swc-releases

- sore points:
    - matching contributions to authors

    - having write access to all the repositories (actually if we copy the content of the lesson then it's not needed)

    - should we rely on GitHub to host the releases?

    - don't use submodules as if the remote branch is deleted then we lose the release, instead copy content of repo in the release repository

    - Test with remote themes


- Teach from stable?
    - poll to maintainers to ask how stable their lesson is
    - poll to instructors to get the feeling about teaching from stable vs latest
    - have toggle/drop-down to switch easily across versions
