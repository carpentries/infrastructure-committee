### Domain names for lessons

Possibilities:

* https://lessons.carpentries.org/<carpentry>/<lesson name>
* https://lessons.<carpentry>.org/<lesson name>
* https://<carpentry>.org/lessons/<lesson-name>
* https://<carpentry>.carpentries.org/<lesson name>

Option 1 looks promising. Especially if coupled with transition to "teaching from stable". The "bleeding edge" version of the lesson could stay the same, and the stable one could be hosted in AWS S3 buckets mapped to https://lessons.carpentries.org/<carpentry>/<lesson name> we could also store past releases in subfolders https://lessons.carpentries.org/<carpentry>/<lesson name>/v201906.01/ This would be minimally disruptive to maintainers. The deployment to S3 buckets could be tied to GitHub releases. Need to draft plan, evaluate changes needed in infrastructure, test

### Starting transition to using remote themes

* source for remote theme: https://github.com/carpentries/carpentries-theme
* example on how to enable it: https://github.com/datacarpentry/genomics-r-intro/blob/master/_config.yml#L101-L102
* example of lesson that uses it: https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/

* need plan for files needed by new lessons
* plan for files that can't be part of remote themes (bin/)
* plan for files that shouldn't(?) be part of the remote themes (e.g., CONTRIBUTING)
