    - https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-infrastructure/issues/24
  - summary:
    - found a package that creates tokens, units of text that are blocks for translation
    - David adapted for reading YAML and code
    - the sofware generates markdown for the translation
    - 1) centralize the lessons
      - there is a lnaguage specific translation file for each lesson
    - 2) link to others
    - key advantage: this manages how to keep translations up to date after english content gets updated
      - enables traking of if it's up to date
  - git submodules: how those are used/are they in the same way how we are considering to use?
    - git doc for submodules: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
    - the central repository for translation will link to a particular version or translation for each lesson on a specific version (git hash) that was generated by the hub for that repo
    - each lesson will be linked as a submodule in a central translation hub repositorythat will 
    - also, git submodule in each lesson repository linking to the translations of that lesson that
    - translated repos should be read only, they're auto generated from the hub
    - only hub version works
  - What does the workflow for translation look like?
    - translator look at stats to prioritze & choose lesson
    - clone and create a file for the new language in the hub, by copying the template
    - sumit PR with the new file
    - new role: language editor- maintainer for linquistic style consistency, glossary
    - language editor reviews, approves
    - after merge automation updated the translated language; gets PR for updated translation link
  - Will the current workflow change for lesson maintainers?
    - they will need to accept automated PRs for language update to ensure up to date links
    - after theme implementation, no extra work for maintainers beyond merging automated PRs
  - What are the key technolgical changes needed?
    - need theme in order to render them jointly
    - need to create hub
    - this system is more sensitive to syntax formatting and use of styles; causes crashes
    - blank lines (2 blank lines)
    - inconsistent file names (eg CoC vs CONDUCT)
    - blank lines are interpretted as token breaks
  - How are travis-based builds integrated in this workflow?
    - manages the build from PO to markdown and the push to updates 
  - Open problems & Discussion:
    - what if someone wants to contribute content to non english
      - initial proposal, have language editors refer to english
      - this is in contrast to wiki-style
    - question: does it learn translations that are incorrect
      - there is no automatic translation, there is still a manual group of people who translate
    - frequencyof translation updates
      - should be tied to release schedule
      - regenerate .po files, they mark what has been done and what needs to be filled in
    - automated translation
      - the .po files are compatible with automated/assisted translation tools, those can be used by translators for creating the files
  - current /planned submotudle use:
    - jekyll themes instead of submodules for styles
    - for releases
  - How do we start to implement this?
    - try a pilot
      - (added after) probably should try the theme first, fix issues with that then pilot the translation part
      - added to the carpentries organizationn
      - shell novice or git already have spansih translations are good case to start
    - onboard maintainers: which are ammenable// Tracy will look
      - Ivan Gonzales - git
    - maybe also pick one new translation to include?
      - this tests the translation workflow
      - Japanese
      - conflates two goals
    - David recommends starting from scratch unders Carpentries organization
      - primarily due to having to make fixes for implementing the styles as 
      - Git is fairly minimal changes, stable content
    - will the approach work for fundamental grammar differences, what are the assumptions on the tokenizing
      - japanese is already working
      - tokenization only happens on english; mostly at paragraph level
 - Update on exercise proposal/conversation
     - discussion session on November 7
