## Minutes


### Follow up on conversation about header levels in lessons

* Following last month meeting, François brought up the guideline that few
  lessons follow to only have level 2 headings in lessons. General consensus
  from maintainers was that going through lessons more systematically to check
  these was a good idea to determine if there is too much content in the
  lessons.

* The conversation among this committee led to the agreement that it is not so
  much which level of header used which is an issue, but rather the number of
  concepts covered in the lesson. Using header levels lower than 2 could
  sometime be useful to structure the content. However, having many level 4
  headers could be indicative that the lesson is going in too much detail.
  Having too many callout boxes could also be an indication that too much
  detail/information is being provided.
  
* Our lessons are however used in different contexts by different audiences.
  Having a lot of information in the lesson could help an experienced instructor
  choose what to cover to match the skill level of the learners. However, having
  too much content to sift through as a new instructor could be intimidating.
  Having more content than what can be covered in a workshop could also be
  useful for learners who go through the lessons on their own after a workshop
  or independently of one.
  
* Making sure that our lessons are designed to cater to their main goals: aimed
  at the intended audience for learners as they attend the workshop; as study
  guides for instructors as they prepare to teach the workshop.
  
* One way to ensure that lessons are structure correctly is to make sure that
  the headers are structured around and match the learning objectives and
  keypoints that are listed in the lessons.
  
* Proposed plan of action:

  - As part of the Curriculum Development handbook, define more clearly how to
    structure the content of the lessons;
  - Put an example of this in the `lesson-example` website/repository;
  - Once the guidelines are in place, write code to test whether the content of
    the lesson conforms to these guidelines.
    
### Reorganization of the exercises

* Sarah presented her
  [proposal](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-infrastructure/issues/21) to
  make exercises a Jekyll collection. Discussion revolves around the fact that
  it's an important change in the way things are structured now and introduces
  more complexity in how the organization of the repository. There is also a
  slightly higher chance that exercises get out of sync with the content of the
  lessons. However, this proposal would provide a lot of flexibility in how the
  exercises are presented and organized to the learners.
* François will send an email to maintainers to see if some are willing to pilot
  it as Maintainers and/or Instructors.
