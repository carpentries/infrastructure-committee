Agenda (add topic you want to discuss below):

1.  Revisit release process (proposed by François)

    We have not been consistent in the way SWC and DC lessons are being released. Rémi Emonet has wrote code to automate process as much as possible for SWC, François has done something similar (but with less features) for DC. Many questions remain to resolved: why are we doing releases in the first place? where to store/archive them? How visible should we make them? Should every contributor be listed and if so in which order? How can we get conscent that contributors want to be listed as authors, and how their names should be displayed? How to get their ORCIDs? What is the exact release process? Who is responsible for what (roles and responsibilites of Maintainers, staff, other volunteers in the community)? 

    François would like to propose putting together a small working group to create a more streamlined and formalized process for lesson releases, and identify for which questions we need to involve the community.

2.  Update on GitHub Labels (François)

    As a pilot of the "How to propose changes?" https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ELwTu2gcwFcpKRfgnZId77ACaBteXC_vnL_RaJtCOH8/edit#heading=h.24zmeyh5w3dy we developed and implemented harmonized GitHub labels for our repositories

    Wrote blog post about the process: www.datacarpentry.org/2018-04-05-github-labels

    All but one (https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-inflammation/issues/346 ) repository involved in the Bug BBQ are using this new set; 5 repositories piloted the initial set. Overall positive feedback, but some concerns as reported here: https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-infrastructure/issues/1

3. reticulate and Rmarkdown for python lessons (François)

    With reticulate (https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/03/26/reticulate-r-interface-to-python/ ) rmarkdown and python integration seems much better which could warrant using rmarkdown for all our lessons. A small working group should test and evaluate feasibility and possible drawbacks. 

4. Docker images for bash/git/python lessons in the browser (proposed by Eric)

    https://jupyter.boisestate.edu/

    https://hub.docker.com/u/boisestate/ - Our docker images, which can be pulled by anyone, if they like

    Another sample of how these are being used http://guoda.bio/ (Debbie)
