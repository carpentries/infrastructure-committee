## Using remote themes

Remote themes seems to be working well. Some of the lessons are using this infrastructure, some are not. How to set up the repositories to keep updating the repositories content? Currently using styles repo to mix a few different things (templates -> remotes repository, build folder scripts, startup templates for creating things for the first time).

New plan, two different repos:
- one for template per se (to be the target of remote themes)
- another for auxilliary files (e.g., content of bin/) with a branch dedicated
  for first time lesson development.

Plan is to get genomics lessons onto remote themes soon.

## Link checking on Travis for R-based lessons

Three categories of lesons re: using Travis:

* No Travis at all
* Travis used to `make lesson-check` command
* R lessons - Travis renders the Rmarkdown files, then this goes to gh-pages to do the rendering to the web pages
        
Want to try and move more lessons to the last model, but some challenges because of the differences between python lessons and R lesson, etc.

FM is working on an R package to check links in the lessons and create a report to alert folks that the link(s) need to be fixed. Currently a first draft, but there are still a good number of dependencies, so it's tricky because using the older version of R that comes with the standard Travis Ubuntu might break some of the dependencies. So either need to reduce dependencies or else create a custom Dockerfile to have the right environment for R, python, ruby, jekyll, etc.

## Web analytics and donations

Originally Software Carpentry was using Google Analytics to track visits to lessons, but then there was some community pushback related to Google and privacy issues. However, it would be great to be able to track the impact of the lessons. Matomo is another analytics provider. This is 100% private, secure, open solution (but have to pay for it, $9 a month) -- https://matomo.org/

Adding a donate button to some of the lesson to start - https://carpentries.wedid.it/
And then if it works add to more lessons later
